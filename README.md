# OSCAL Website Content Repository

This supports the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) Program](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) through the [Public NIST Website](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/).

The [OSCAL website](https://www.nist.gov/oscal) provides an overview of the OSCAL project, including an XML and JSON [schema reference](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/), [examples](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/examples/), and other resources.

If you are interested in contributing to the development of OSCAL, refer to the [contributor guidance](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

You can also post publicly to the OSCAL development list: [oscal-dev@list.nist.gov](mailto:oscal-dev@list.nist.gov) or [create an issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues) on our GitHub repository.

# Using this Repository

## Cloning from GitHub

Run the following Git command to clone the OSCAL-Pages repository, and you can begin editing content without any special setup.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-Pages.git
```

The website content in this repository is generated into the full website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  If you wish to run the website locally, you can either install hugo, or use Docker and docker-compose.

## Using Hugo

In terminal:

```sh
hugo server -s ./src --enableGitInfo=false --verbose --debug --minify
```

## Using Docker Compose

In terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

You can use CTRL+C to stop the server.

# How this Works

- The `develop` branch is where all content is merged and PR'd for publication.
- Once content is ready for release, the `develop` branch will be merged into `main` with a PR.
- When this occurs the workflow will begin the publication process.
- The static site generator (`hugo`) will generate the website.
- Rendered content will be placed into the `published-pages` branch.
- The content from `published-pages` will be copied (pushed) to the OSCAL project `nist-pages` branch.
- The site will update.

There is a `nist-pages` branch in OSCAL-Pages, but we are not using this since it will 
publish a site at https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Pages.  Since redirects are not supported, we cross push to the OSCAL repository directly.
