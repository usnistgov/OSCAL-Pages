Detailed release notes are provided with each OSCAL [release](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases).

The following are extra release notes for some older OSCAL releases.

## OSCAL 1.0.0 Release

The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2.

### Overall changes

The following general changes were made in this release.

- In prior releases for some JSON objects, an object's identifier was used as a property.

  For example:
  ```json
  {
    "identifer1": {
      "comment": "remainder of object 1"
    },
    "identifer2": {
      "comment": "remainder of object 2"
    }
  }
  ```
  
  While this "BY_KEY" notation does enforce uniqueness of identifiers, this syntax is difficult to write parsers for. This release removes the use of this syntax in favor of a simple array of objects. See issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#914](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/914).
  
- In prior OSCAL releases, the data types used in the OSCAL XML and JSON schemas did not require that provided strings are non-empty (see issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#805](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805)), and leading and trailing whitespace was also allowed (see issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#805](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805)). Some XML parsers that are schema aware are capable of removing this extra whitespace based on the `whiteSpace="collapse"` schema facet. This only works if the parser is schema aware. To normalize this behavior across all parsers, the OSCAL string data types will now not allow leading and trailing whitespace.

  This led to updates to the string data types in XML and JSON. The `ncname` data type was also replaced by `token` (see issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#911](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/911)).

### Changes to Profile Model

In /profile/modify/alter ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters), [XML](/reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter)) the following changes were made. See issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#928](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/928).

- The item remove ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters/removes), [XML](/reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter/remove)) has had its child properties/attributes renamed as follows:
  - name-ref -> by-name
  - class-ref -> by-class
  - id-ref -> by-id
  - item-name -> by-item-name
  - ns-ref -> by-ns

- The item add ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters/adds), [XML](/reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter/add)) has had its child properties/attributes renamed as follows:
  - id-ref -> by-id

### Changes to System Security Plan Model

In /system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/system-security-plan/json-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirements), [XML](/reference/latest/system-security-plan/xml-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement))

- The item control-id ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/system-security-plan/json-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirements/control-id), [XML](/reference/latest/system-security-plan/xml-reference/#/system-security-plan/control-implementation/implemented-requirement/@control-id)) is now required
- In XML the ordering of elements has changed (i.e. responsible-role was moved in the sequence). This change was made to keep the XML element sequencing consistent between this model and the component definition model.

### Changes to Assessment Results Model

- The item findings ([JSON/YAML](/reference/latest/assessment-results/json-reference/#/assessment-results/results/findings), [XML](/reference/latest/assessment-results/xml-reference/#/assessment-results/result/finding)) is now optional. See issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#918](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/918).

## OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate 2

The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2 since OSCAL 1.0.0 RC 1.

- Simplification of key OSCAL features
  - Properties and annotations have been merged into a single `prop` that now allows an optional `remarks` and `uuid`.
  - In the  assessment plan and assessment results models, the concepts of a `task` and `action` have been combined.
  - Use of `local-definitions` in the assessment plan, assessment results, and POA&M models has been simplified and made more consistent.
- Model documentation improvements
  - Some usage descriptions were enhanced to provide more detail and to be more consistent overall.
  - Formal names were updated in some places where the names did not match the data element.
  - Many spelling errors were corrected.
- Removed the use of XML `<any>` and JSON `additonalProperties` for arbitrary extensions based on community discussion. Extended data can still be provided using `link` declarations to external content. This decision can be revisited in future revisions once there is more implementation experience with the OSCAL models.
- Added the following `link` relations: `latest-version`, `predecessor-version`, and `successor-version` to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.
- Fixed a few bugs in the profile resolver code and updated the resolver to work with new profile import/insert structures.
- Provided support for data insertion points for data other than parameters in markup content.

### Changes common to all models

- "props" and "annotations" in JSON, and "prop" and "annotation" in XML, have been merged into a single property that now allows an optional `remark` and `uuid`. Semantically, the optional `remark` and `uuid` were the only difference between a "prop" and an "annotation" in OSCAL. The resulting model is simpler with a single construct that will always allow a remark. Names and values that were allowed on annotations are now allowed on properties.
- `latest-version`, `predecessor-version`, and `successor-version` link relations were added to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.
- Markup content may now contain data insertion points for data other than parameters. The `insert` object, which may appear in markup content strings, now supports a `type` which can be used to indicate the type of data to insert, and an `id-ref` that identifies the specific data object to take data from.

### Model-Specific Changes

#### Catalog and Profile

- Remarks were added to `param` declarations.
- The import/insert structure in OSCAL profiles has been updated to align with the include/exclude syntax used in the assessment models. This lays the groundwork for more dynamic extension and expansion of include/exclude capabilities in future releases.

#### Component Definition

- `set-parameter` was added to `/component-definition/component(s)//control-implementations` to allow for parameter values to be more conveniently defined for all control implementations.

#### Assessment Plan and Assessment Results

- The concepts of task and action were combined, resulting in only the concept of a task. A task now has a type, which defines if the task is a "milestone" or "action". This resulted in the following changes:
  - `/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/action(s)` was removed.
  - `/assessment-results/results/assessment-log/entry/related-action(s)` was removed.
  - A task can now define a `dependency` on another task.
- In multiple locations `assessment-subject` has been renamed to `subject` to be more consistent. Before there was a mixture of names.
- In JSON the `/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions//parts` is always an array. In RC1, if a single part object was provided, the value was a single object.
- In JSON the `/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods` was renamed to "objectives-and-methods". Similarly, in XML `/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods` was renamed to "objectives-and-methods".
- In JSON and XML `/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/assessment-assets` has been added to allow each result to declare which assessment assets were used during the assessment, if these assets differ from what was defined in the assessment plan. This construct was moved from `/assessment-results/results`.
- In JSON and XML `/assessment-results/results/assessment-subject` has been removed. This was originally used to add subjects that were not found in the assessment plan or SSP. In `/assessment-results/results/local-definitions` you can specify `component(s)`, `inventory-item(s)`, and `user(s)` definitions. These allow the identification of subjects that are not in the assessment plan or SSP, making `assessment-subject` unneeded.
- In `/assessment-results/results/finding` the `collected` and `expires` was removed, since this is an aspect of the observation, not the finding.
- In `/assessment-results/results/finding` the `objective-status` has been replaced by `finding-target` which can now be used to provide a status on a per-subject basis. This allows a finding to be associated with multiple related subjects that might have different states.

## OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate 1

The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 1 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 3.

Changes in this release have been focused on the following major areas:
- Making naming in XML and JSON/YAML more consistent.
- Ensuring that all data types and cardinalities are appropriate.
- Refactoring to cleanup models, making them: 1) more consistent with the other OSCAL models, 2) making them more simple when possible, and 3) providing room for future addition of new features.

### Changes common to all models

- many elements in XML, and properties in JSON and YAML, have been renamed to make the naming more consistent between elements names in XML and property names in JSON and YAML. Now JSON properties that contain an array of objects use a plural form of the XML element name. The one exception is "prop" in XML vs "properties" in JSON and YAML. This decision was made to make the XML use of "prop" more concise, since "prop" elements are used a good deal in OSCAL XML formats.

#### Changes to all XML formats

In {top-level-element}/metadata:
- renamed "revision-history" to "revisions"

In {top-level-object}/metadata/parties:
- renamed "party-name" to "name"
- renamed "properties" to "props"
- made use of addresses and location-uuids mutually exclusive, since either a static address or a reference to location provides similar functionality.

### Changes to the system security plan (SSP) model

A number of changes have been made to the SSP model to support the use of leveraged authorizations. Another key change is the use of the "this-system" component to define controls at the system-level. This now means that all SSPs will make use of at least one component.

### Refactoring of the assessment and assessment result layer models

The assessment plan, assessment results, and plan of actions and milestones models have undergone some significant revisions. These revisions have been based on community feedback and a need to provide more extensibility for future growth. Extra review of these models is appreciated as we make preparations for the OSCAL 1.0.0 FINAL release.

### Changes to the assessment plan model

Due to the nature of changes in this model, the following documentation details how the new model roughly maps to the older 1.0.0-milestone3 model. The following changes have been made in the XML, JSON, and YAML formats for the OSCAL assessment plan model.

#### Changes to the assessment plan XML format

/assessment-plan/local-definitions

- The structures located in /assessment-plan/assessment-subjects/local-definitions has been moved here. This includes the component, inventory-item, and user element constructions. This allows all content that augments the content from the referenced SSP to be located within a top-level element.
- The "add-objectives-and-methods" element has been added which allow the definitions of new assessment objectives and methods which are to be used in the assessment, but are not located in the catalog for which the system's baseline is generated from. This replaces the original elements located in /assessment-plan/objectives/objective and /assessment-plan/objectives/method.
- The "activity" element has been added to allow an assessment process to be defined. These assessment activities can then be referenced by a specific assessment-action.

/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions

- This new element provides a means to include textual front matter in the assessment plan. This can be used to define rules of engagement, activities to include/exclude from assessments, instructions for delivering results, etc.

/assessment-plan/reviewed-controls

- This element includes constructs that previously appeared under /assessment-plan/objectives in the "controls" and "control-objectives" elements. We believe the inclusion/exclusion syntax used now is simpler, more concise, and easier to process.

/assessment-plan/assessment-subject

- This element replaces the previous /assessment-plan/assessment-subjects element.
- The old version intermixed included and excluded subjects of different types.
- The new construction pairs includes/excludes of a given type, which should make processing easier and more straightforward.

/assessment-plan/assessment-assets

- This new element replaces the previous /assessment-plan/assets element.
- The old element allowed tools to be defined and used "origination" as a way to loosely associate information (e.g., IP addresses used with assessment tools) with these tools.
- The new construction allows for "assessment-platforms" to be identified, which can combine referenced tool components using "uses-component" in multiple combinations providing more control over defining information about tooling used during an assessment. Information that applies to the platform, such as IP addresses used, can be defined using the "prop" element on the "assessment-platform".

/assessment-plan/assessment-action

- This new element replaces the /assessment-plan/assessment-activities/test-method element.
- The old element required that information about an assessment process was defined by a "test-method".
- The new construction allows:
  - The use of "associated-activity" to reference an "activity" defined under /assessment-plan/local-definitions, which allows the same activity to be used multiple times across different assessment-action elements.
  - Use of "assessment-subject" to define in a fine-grained the targeting of subjects the assessment-action are to be performed against.
  - Use of the "responsible-role" element to identify assessment roles and optionally parties which are associated with the action.

/assessment-plan/task

- This element updates the old element located in /assessment-plan/assessment-activities/schedule/task
- "title" is now required.
- "activity-uuid" is replaced with "related-action".
- "party-uuid" and "location-uuid" is now specified on a per-action basis using the referenced "assessment-action" element's "assessment-subject" entries, which allows both parties and locations to be subjects.
- "compare-to" has been removed, since this was intended to be used in assessment-results only.

#### Changes to the assessment plan JSON and YAML formats

/assessment-plan/local-definitions

- The structures located in /assessment-plan/assessment-subjects/local-definitions has been moved here. This includes the components, inventory-items, and users object constructions. This allows all content that augments the content from the referenced SSP to be located within a top-level element.
- Use of "protocols" has been removed in lieu of defining "network" or "service" components under local-definitions.
- The "add-objectives-and-methods" object array has been added which allow the definitions of new assessment objectives and methods which are to be used in the assessment, but are not located in the catalog for which the system's baseline is generated from. This replaces the original objects located in /assessment-plan/objectives/objectives and /assessment-plan/objectives/method-definitions.
- The "activities" object array has been added to allow an assessment process to be defined. These assessment activities can then be referenced by a specific assessment-action.

/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions

- This new object provides a means to include textual front matter in the assessment plan. This can be used to define rules of engagement, activities to include/exclude from assessments, instructions for delivering results, etc.

/assessment-plan/reviewed-controls

- This element includes constructs that previously appeared under /assessment-plan/objectives in the "control-group" and "control-objective-group" object arrays. We believe the inclusion/exclusion syntax used now is simpler, more concise, and easier to process.

/assessment-plan/assessment-subject

- This element replaces the previous /assessment-plan/assessment-subjects element.
- The old version intermixed included and excluded subjects of different types.
- The new construction pairs includes/excludes of a given type, which should make processing easier and more straightforward.

/assessment-plan/assessment-assets

- This new element replaces the previous /assessment-plan/assets element.
- The old element allowed tools to be defined and used "origination" as a way to loosely associate information (e.g., IP addresses used with assessment tools) with these tools.
- The new construction allows for "assessment-platforms" to be identified, which can combine referenced tool components using "uses-components" in multiple combinations providing more control over defining information about tooling used during an assessment. Information that applies to the platform, such as IP addresses used, can be defined using the "props" object array on an "assessment-platforms" array item object.

/assessment-plan/assessment-actions

- This new element replaces the /assessment-plan/assessment-activities/test-methods element.
- The old element required that information about an assessment process was defined by "test-methods".
- The new construction allows:
  - The use of "associated-activities" to reference an "activity" defined under /assessment-plan/local-definitions, which allows the same activity to be used multiple times across different assessment-action elements.
  - Use of "assessment-subjects" to define in a fine-grained the targeting of subjects the assessment-action are to be performed against.
  - Use of the "responsible-roles" to identify assessment roles and optionally parties which are associated with the action.

/assessment-plan/tasks

- This element updates the old element located in /assessment-plan/assessment-activities/schedule/tasks
- "title" is now required.
- "activity-uuids" is replaced with "related-actions".
- "party-uuids" and "location-uuids" are now specified on a per-action basis using the referenced "assessment-action" object's "assessment-subjects" array items, which allows both parties and locations to be subjects.
- "compare-to" has been removed, since this was intended to be used in assessment-results only.


### Changes to the assessment results model

Due to the nature of changes in this model, the following documentation details how the new model roughly maps to the older 1.0.0-milestone3 model. The following changes have been made in the XML, JSON, and YAML formats for the OSCAL assessment results model.

#### Changes to assessment results XML format

/assessment-results

- Most of the top-level elements in this model have been relocated under the "result" element or it's children. This allows the assessment details to be specified for each result set. This better supports continuous and evolving assessments.

/assessment-results/local-definitions

- The "objective" element relocates and updates the old element in /assessment-results/objectives/objective allowing new assessment objectives to be defined that were not defined in the catalog supporting the system's baseline or the assessment plan.
- The new "activity" element is similar to the related one in the assessment plan, and allows an assessment process to be defined. These assessment activities can then be referenced by a specific assessment-action.

/assessment-results/results/local-definitions

- The structures located in /assessment-results/assessment-subjects/local-definitions has been moved here. This includes the "component", "inventory-item", and "user" element constructions. This allows all content that augments the content from the referenced SSP to be located within a top-level element.
- The "add-objectives-and-methods" element has been added which allow the definitions of new assessment objectives and methods which are to be used in the assessment, but are not located in the catalog for which the system's baseline is generated from. This replaces the original elements located in /assessment-results/objectives/objective and /assessment-results/objectives/method.
/assessment-results/results/assessment-actions
- The "assessment-action" element replaces the /assessment-plan/assessment-activities/test-methods element.
  - The old element required that information about an assessment process was defined by "test-methods". This structure was moved to local-definitions, since this is adding to the actions defined in the assessment plan.
  - The new construction allows:
    - The use of "associated-activities" to reference an "activity" defined under /assessment-plan/local-definitions, which allows the same activity to be used multiple times across different assessment-action elements.
    - Use of "assessment-subjects" to define in a fine-grained the targeting of subjects the assessment-action are to be performed against.
    - Use of the "responsible-roles" to identify assessment roles and optionally parties which are associated with the action.

/assessment-results/results/reviewed-controls

- This element includes constructs that previously appeared under /assessment-results/objectives in the "controls" and "control-objectives" elements. We believe the inclusion/exclusion syntax used now is simpler, more concise, and easier to process.

- An "entry" can be used to log any event that occurs during an assessment.
  - An "entry" can be associated with an action or a task. An action is a concrete activity that is performed during an assessment, while a task is a high-level scheduled event used for project management that may be associated with multiple actions. The two can be used together to detail the work accomplished during the assessment.
  - The "related-action" element can associate the log entry with an action declared in the plan or the results to record progress on or completion of the action. The "related-action" can be used to assign a "responsible-party" and can also be associated with an "assessment-subject".
  - The "related-task" element can associate the log entry with a task declared in the plan to record progress on or completion of the task. The "related-task" can be used to assign a "responsible-party" and can also be associated with an "assessment-subject".
  - "title" is now required.
  - "activity-uuids" is replaced with "related-actions".

- renamed "observation-method" to "method"
- renamed "observation-type" to "type"
- "assessor" has been replaced with "origin", which allows the tool, assessment-platform, and/or any parties to be identified as one or more "actor" elements. The related action and/or task can also be associated here using "related-action" and "related-task".

/assessment-results/results/risk

- This element updates the old element located in /assessment-results/results/finding/risk. Risks have been separated out from findings to allow a given risk to be linked to by many findings.
- Renamed "risk-status" to "status"

- Replaced "risk-metric" with "characterization", which allows any risk characteristic to be as a "facet". The specific tool, assessment-platform, and/or any parties producing a characterization can be identified using one or more "actor" elements. The related action and/or task can also be associated here using "related-action" and "related-task".
- All remediation related contents has been moved to "response", which will be discussed below.
- A "risk-log/entry" can be used to identify any action that relates to the assessment of or handling of a risk. This replaces the "/assessment-results/results/risk/remediation-tracking", while proving more robust capabilities.
- "party-id" has been replaced with identifying the party as an actor under "origin".

/assessment-results/results/risk/response

- This new element realigns all of the risk/remediation information in a way that supports other risk response activities in addition to remediation.
- "origin" allows the tool, assessment-platform, and/or party identifying the response to be identified, replacing /assessment-results/results/risk/remediation-origin.
- "task" is used to define a schedule of events replacing /assessment-results/results/risk/remediation-deadline and /assessment-results/results/risk/remediation/schedule/task. This allows risk responses to be defined in a more fine-grained way.
- Renamed "required" to "required-asset"

/assessment-results/results/finding

- This element maps to the same element in the old model.
- Moved the embedded "observation" and "risk" elements to "related-observation" and "associated-risk" references.

#### Changes to assessment results JSON and YAML formats

/assessment-results

- Most of the top-level properties in this model have been relocated under the "results" property or it's child objects. This allows the assessment details to be specified for each result set. This better supports continuous and evolving assessments.

### Changes to the plan of actions and milestones (PO&M) model

Due to the nature of changes in this model, the following documentation details how the new model roughly maps to the older 1.0.0-milestone3 model. The following changes have been made in the XML, JSON, and YAML formats for the OSCAL PO&M model.

#### Changes to the plan of actions and milestones XML formats

- The PO&M XML format has been updated to align with the assessment results XML format. Most of the changes in the previous section related to assessment results apply here.

/plan-of-action-and-milestones/poam-item

- Like the assessment results, the "poam-item" now has the "observation" and "risk" elements broken out as siblings and references to these elements are used instead.
- Removed "objective-status" and "implementation-status-uuid, since this was added here by mistake and is covered in the assessment results.

#### Changes to the plan of actions and milestones JSON and YAML formats

- The PO&M JSON and YAML format has been updated to align with the assessment results JSON and YAML format. Most of the changes in the previous section related to assessment results apply here.

/plan-of-action-and-milestones/poam-items

- Replaces /plan-of-action-and-milestones/poam-items/poam-item-group
- Like the assessment results, the "poam-items" now has the "observation" and "risk" elements broken out as siblings and references to these objects are used instead.
- Removed "objective-status" and "implementation-status-uuid, since this was added here by mistake and is covered in the assessment results.

## OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 3
--

### New OSCAL models

The following new models have been added to OSCAL.

- Component Definition model: Allows for the definition of a set of *components* that each provide a description of the controls supported by a specific implementation of a hardware, software, or service; or by a given policy, process, procedure, or compliance artifact (e.g., FIPS 140-2 validation).
- Assessment Plan model: Represents the planning for a periodic or continuous assessment.
- Assessment Results model: Represents the findings of a periodic or continuous assessment of a specific system.
- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) model: Represents the known risks for a specific system, as well as the identified deviations, remediation plan, and disposition status of each risk.

### Changes to all Models

#### Changing 'name' flag to 'title' field

On several assemblies, what had been represented with a 'name' flag is now represented with a 'title' field, which permits inline markup.

'title' now appears in these assemblies: 'metadata', 'revision', 'location', 'resource', 'role', 'information-type', 'leveraged-authorization', 'user', 'authorized-privilege', 'component', and 'protocol'.

#### Changes of ID to UUID

A number of assemblies that used to carry 'id' flags now carry 'uuid' flags instead. These include (in the SSP model) : 'location', 'party', 'resource', 'diagram', 'user', 'component', 'protocol', 'inventory-item', 'implemented-requirement', 'statement', and 'by-component'. In all models, it includes 'location', 'party', and 'resource'. Finally, the full assemblies 'catalog', 'profile' and 'system-security-plan' fall into this category.

Similarly, flags and fields that are named to indicate they provide a point of reference, are now renamed '-uuid' reflecting when their references is given specifically as a 'uuid' (and validated as such) not as an 'id'. These include 'location-uuid' and 'party-uuid'.

#### 'metadata' changes

Milestone 3 has two assemblies in the metadata, revision for tracking a revision history, and location, an abstraction (and alternative) to the older address modeling.

[M2] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)

[M3] model: title (field), published? (field), last-modified (field), version (field), oscal-version (field), revision* (assembly), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), link* (field), role* (assembly), location* (assembly), party* (assembly), responsible-party* (assembly), remarks? (field)

##### New 'revision' assembly: Revision History Entry (all models)

Tracking revisions can now be done by capturing a snapshot of metadata at an earlier point, potentially with properties or remarks added to indicate revision status or purpose.

[M3] model: title? (field), published? (field), last-modified? (field), version? (field), oscal-version? (field), prop* (field), link* (field), remarks? (field)

##### New 'location' assembly: Location (all models)

A new assembly permits factoring out geographic or contact information (an address or contact point) into a separate data structure, for reference using its 'uuid' flag.

[M3] model: title? (field), address (assembly), email* (field), phone* (field), url* (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)

##### New 'location-uuid': Location Reference

##### 'party' changes (all models)

'party' is for Party (organization or person). It has been refactored to reflect the (somewhat arbitrary) 'organization' vs 'person' distinction into a 'type' flag.

Where before, we had an 'id' flag, now we have 'uuid'. We also have 'type', a flag whose value can capture "person" or "organization".

We also have new fields for linking to other assemblies, including 'member-of-organization'. Instead of 'org-name' and 'person-name' we simply have 'party-name'.

[M2] flags: id?

[M3] flags: uuid?, type?

[M2] model: person* (assembly), org? (assembly), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), remarks? (field)

[M3] model: party-name (field), short-name? (field), external-id* (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), address* (assembly), email* (field), phone* (field), member-of-organization (field), location-uuid (field)**, remarks? (field)

##### New field 'party-uuid': Party Reference

Replaces 'person/id' and 'org/id' from the M2 model.

##### New field 'external-id': Personal Identifier

Replaces 'party-id' and 'org-id' from the M2 model.

##### New field 'member-of-organization': Organizational Affiliation

Used to associate a person or organization with another organization. This can be used to create organization hierarchies.

##### New field 'party-name': Party Name

Replaces 'org-name' and 'person-name' from the M2 model.

#### 'back-matter' changes

In the back matter, the old 'citation' element has been refactored as a special case of 'resource'.

[M2] model: citation* (assembly), resource* (assembly)

[M3] model: resource* (assembly)

##### Refactored 'resource': Resource

The old 'citation' assembly is now a child, not a sibling of resource within 'back-matter'. As such it has been remodeled to support as much specialized citation information as may be available for a resource.

[M2] flag: id?

[M3] flags: uuid?

[M2] model: desc? (field), prop* (field), (A choice: rlink* (assembly), base64? (field) ) , remarks? (field)

[M3] model: title? (field), desc? (field), prop* (field), doc-id* (field), citation? (assembly), rlink* (assembly), base64* (field), remarks? (field), (any)

New assemblies and fields to support the citation model.

##### New field 'text': Biblographic Text

A plain-text capture of a bibliographic citation.

##### New assembly 'biblio': Bibliographic Definition

A structured representation of a bibliographic resource (an extension point).

##### 'citation' changes

A 'citation' now appears only as a child of a 'resource'.

[M2] flag: id?

[M3] flag: [none]

[M2] model:  target* (field), title? (field), desc? (field), doc-id* (field), prop* (field), ? (any)

[M3] model: text (field), prop* (field), biblio? (assembly)


### Changes to the Profile Model

#### Change to 'add': Addition (profile model)

A new 'id-ref' flag permits targeting an addition to a particular object (branch) within the structure addressed for addition. Additionally, an 'annotation' element may also be added.

[M2] flag: position?

[M3] flags: position?, id-ref?

[M2] model: title? (field), param* (assembly), prop* (field), link* (field), part* (assembly)

[M3] model: title? (field), param* (assembly), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), part* (assembly)

### Changes to the System Security Plan (SSP) Model

#### 'system-implementation' changes

An assembly for 'leveraged-authorization' has been added. 'leveraged-authorization' used to be in 'system-characteristics'.

[M2] model: prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), user* (assembly), component* (assembly), service* (assembly), interconnection* (assembly), system-inventory? (assembly), remarks? (field)

[M3] model: prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), leveraged-authorization* (assembly), user* (assembly), component* (assembly), system-inventory? (assembly), remarks? (field)

#### 'component' changes

The component assembly has been remodeled to permit greater generality and expressiveness. New assemblies include 'title', 'purpose', and 'protocol'.

[M2] flags: id?, name?, component-type?

[M3] flags: uuid?, component-type?

[M2] model: description (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), status (assembly), responsible-role* (assembly), remarks? (field)

[M3] model: title (field), description (field), purpose? (field), prop* (field), annotation* (assembly), link* (field), status (assembly), responsible-role* (assembly), protocol* (assembly), remarks? (field)

#### Rename 'set-param' to 'set-parameter'

In profile SSP models, the assembly used to set a parameter is consistently called 'set-parameter'.

##  OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 2

### New OSCAL Features

- A System Security Plan (SSP) model has been added to OSCAL for use by organizations to document the implementation of security and privacy controls in an information system.

### Breaking Changes

The following content model changes have been made to the catalog and profile models that may break content compatibility:

#### Document metadata

  * `last-modified` is now required. Its value must be a date-time with time zone (i.e., a timestamp). The old element `last-modified-date` is no longer permitted.
  * `published` is permitted for a nominal publication date, as assigned by the owner or publisher of the catalog or resource. An electronic version of a previously published catalog should carry its own publication date, if any, not that of the original resource (which can be described elsewhere with its own metadata).
  * `role-id` is now assigned as an element in the XML, not an attribute. This permits it to be tokenized more explicitly.

#### Control structures in the catalog model

##### New property in SP800-53 catalog data

In the SP800-53 catalog, we have added a property called `sort-id` to controls and enhancements. Its string value represents the control's ID in a (zero-padded) notation that will sort gracefully against other `sort-id` values. This permits a robust reordering of controls in receiving systems without having to refer to an out-of-line document to restore the canonical order.

##### Controls inside controls, but no "subcontrols"

Control enhancements are now represented using `control` not `subcontrol`. The advantages of restricting to two levels of hierarchy (even given groups and parts) became too few in view of the sacrifices to expressiveness so we have gone back to clean recursion.

#### Data type handling

Data type handling has been extended in several respects to provide for the validating of lexical forms of nominal datatypes. Datatypes for dates and times have been added. Several XML-peculiar datatypes have been removed.

##### Value enumeration on terminal nodes

The schema has also been extended to support validation against enumerated values, either exclusively (only declared values may appear) or inclusively (enumerations are documented while other values are also permitted). All allowed values now being declared (Milestone 2) are inclusive of other values (user- or application-defined), so this is not a breaking change.

Affected data points (in both models): `prop/name`, `address/type`, `phone/type`, `hash/algorithm`, `role-id`. The enumerated values provided for each are documented.

##### Lexical datatyping at points

Supported for lexical datatyping has also been added to `link/href`, `rlink/href` (URI references), `published` and `last-modified` (timestamps), `email` (a nominal email address), `url` (a URI), `img/src`.

#### Profile model enhancements

##### Calling control enhancements (old "subcontrols")

From call statements, since `subcontrol` has been dropped from the catalog model, `subcontrol-id` has been replaced with `control-id`, and `with-subcontrols` has been replaced by `with-child-controls` (on `call`, `all` and `match`). Essentially, a subcontrol is now represented as a control that is a child another parent control.

##### Expanded model for new groups

Elements besides control references are now permitted inside `group` within the `merge` construct, so profile authors can provide titles and introductory content to groups they define for their represented aggregate control structures.

##### Parameter settings

Added 'guideline' to profile model. It was omitted in error.
