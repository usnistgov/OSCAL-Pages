{{% usa-intro %}}OSCAL DEFINE (**D**evelop **E**nhancements, **F**uture **I**mplementations and **N**ew **E**ducation) is a new meeting to discuss the research and educational pursuits of OSCAL using an iterative and collaborative approach with the community.  Our goal is to establish an OSCAL research framework that allows topics to receive the necessary definition and understanding sufficient to create educational content, demonstrate usage in practice, gain communityâ€™s endorsement, and serve as a catalyst for continued development of OSCAL.{{% /usa-intro %}}
