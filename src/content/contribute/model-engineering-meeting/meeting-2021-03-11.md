- Open discussion.

## Notes

- Discussed [Sprint 40](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/projects/39) status.
- Held a discussion on community need for tutorials or "cookbook recipes" to illustrate how to use various OSCAL features.
  - Use of components vs capabilities within an OSCAL [component definition](/concepts/layer/implementation/component-definition/). Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#854](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/854) for this.
    - Address how a capability is to be used
    - Identify how component and capability content is used in the creation of a [SSP](/concepts/layer/implementation/ssp/).
  - Show how to include assessment evidence in an OSCAL [assessment result](/concepts/layer/assessment/assessment-results/) based on the assessment of a given control. Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#855](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/855) for this.
  - Illustrate how OSCAL extension points (i.e., property, annotation, and links) can be used to provide extended data. Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#857](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/857) for this.
  - Show how to create an [SSP](/concepts/layer/implementation/ssp/) with multiple components. Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#862](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/862) for this.
- Discussed the need for FedRAMP to provide instructions and a tutorial for posting OSCAL-based packages to the OMB Max portal. AJ will follow up with the FedRAMP team.
- Discussed the need to define parties in an external OSCAL document, which can be imported into multiple OSCAL documents. Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#859](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/859) for this.
- Discuss the need to review model documentation on identifier scoping and uniqueness. Created issue [usnistgov/OSCAL#860](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/860) for this.
