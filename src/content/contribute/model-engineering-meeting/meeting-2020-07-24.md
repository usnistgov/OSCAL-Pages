## Slides

- Using Leveraged Authorizations in OSCAL ([PDF](/presentations/oscal-leveraged-authorizations-v2.pdf)) presented by [Brian Ruf](https://github.com/brian-ruf).

## Agenda

- Review the proposed approach for leveraging existing authorizations and composing systems.
- Open discussion.

## Notes

- After discussion, there was some consensus the the suggested approach for leveraged authorizations will likely work.
- Need to identify a method to point to a non-OSCAL customer responsibility matrix (CRM) in the OSCAL SSP for the leveraging system.
