## Slides

- Using Leveraged Authorizations in OSCAL ([PDF](/presentations/oscal-leveraged-authorizations-v3.pdf)) presented by [Brian Ruf](https://github.com/brian-ruf).

## Agenda

- Review the proposed approach for leveraging existing authorizations and composing systems.
- Open discussion.

## Notes

- Brian Ruf presented the slides

- May need to add a property to identify the authorization period
- May need to support multiple authorizations in a single SSP. FedRAMP authorizations start with an initial agency authorization.
- Need to figure out how a leveraged authorization would point to either a leveraged SSP (existing) or a leveraged CRM (new). This would avoid the need to duplicate component information in the leveraging SSP.
- Inheritance of control implementation
    1. Don't propagate
    1. Propagate fully
    1. Propagate partially
- What is the default model for propagation? Always propagate if not addressed or never propagate.
