OSCAL is a community-driven, NIST-led project, with an [open invitation](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the community to participate in the framing and development of OSCAL. Feature requests can be [created and submitted](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/new?assignees=&labels=User+Story%2C+enhancement&template=feature_request.md) directly into the project's GitHub repository. Feedback in the form of [bug reports](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) are also encouraged and appreciated. If appropriate, we ask you add a comment to an [existing relevant issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues), and only create a new issue when no relevant issue exists. Before opening an issue, we ask that you review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Development Epics

OSCAL is being designed and created over a series of development epics leveraging an incremental and agile approach. Each epic consists of a series of sprints focused on reaching a defined milestone. This approach allows the project team to provide increased value over time at an accelerated pace, by focusing on an 80% solution (Minimally Viable Product (MVP)) that can be implemented in 20% of the time.

Each [milestone](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/milestones) will result in an incremental release of OSCAL resources.

## OSCAL v1

OSCAL version 1 is currently being maintained and enhanced over a series of [releases](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases), the [latest](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/latest) of which can be found on Github.

We will continue to address any defects, improve documentation, and add features where possible over a series of minor and defect fix releases. Minor releases will be be indicated as `1.x.0`, where `x` will be incremented for each minor release. This may include backporting features being worked on in the OSCAL 2.0.0 release epics. Defect fix releases will be indicated as `1.x.y`, where `x` will be the current minor release and `y` will be incremented for each defect fix release. This will allow adopters to benefit from releases against a stable and supported OSCAL v1, while we work on significant new features in OSCAL v2.

## OSCAL v2

Similar to OSCAL v1, the second major version of OSCAL, OSCAL v2, will be developed over a series of milestone releases. We have not yet planned a specific set of milestones in the OSCAL v2 epic. We will start planning OSCAL v2 as are near wrapping up OSCAL v1. An initial [milestone](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/milestone/5) has been established to organize issues for future work on OSCAL v2.
