{{<callout>}}*Audit and assessment personnel who validate the accuracy of security plans and assess the implementation of security controls within information systems.*{{</callout>}}

OSCAL standardizes the format for documentation of security controls, while establishing a framework for the automated assessment of information systems to be evaluated based the state of the security controls being addressed.

## How Does OSCAL Help Me?

- Reduces the amount of manual labor need to assess the implementation of controls.
- Provides ongoing, automated assessment of an information systems assurance, allowing any drift in control implementation to be detected as it occurs, reducing overall risk.
- Enables mapping standard catalogs of controls and common baselines, to system implementations, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple frameworks.
