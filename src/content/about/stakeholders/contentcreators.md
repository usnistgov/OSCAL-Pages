{{<callout>}}*Systems security policy professionals who set requirements for security programs, both across and within organizations and agencies*{{</callout>}}

OSCAL provides a standardized solution for building security baselines, through the use of OSCAL profiles, that set the expectations for control implementation within one or more programs and associated information systems.

## How Does OSCAL Help Me?

- Ensures consistency of control implementation across the enterprise.
- Improves the transparency of policy implementation by automating reviews of security control implementation and assessments.
- Permits market-based development of shared OSCAL profiles, working across agencies, compliance frameworks and domains.
- Improves the Machine Experience (MX) for vendors in implementing enterprise-specific policies by representing them in a standardized format.
