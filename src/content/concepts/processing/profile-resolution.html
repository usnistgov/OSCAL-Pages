<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e8-head">Notice of Draft Status</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Please note that this specification is currently a work in progress and is subject to change. If you have any feedback or comments, please create an issue at the NIST OSCAL Github Repository: <a class="a" href="https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL">github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL</a>.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e15-head">Abstract</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This specification provides the minimal requirements for processing an OSCAL Profile to create a new OSCAL Catalog Document. This process of applying a profile to a catalog to create a new catalog is called
      <b class="term">Profile Resolution</b>. Not all OSCAL Profiles will be resolved, nor are expected to be; however, the resolution requirements in this document are crucial to understanding the intended functionality of any given OSCAL Profile.
       This specification is intended for software developers who intend to develop an OSCAL Profile Resolver, or for OSCAL Profile authors who want a more in-depth understanding of profile resolution.
    </p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e21-head">Introduction</h2><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e23-head">Purpose</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This document defines the normative requirements for an OSCAL Profile Resolver. Profile resolution is core to addressing a fundamental OSCAL requirement: 
        the representation of baselines separately from the control catalogs on which they depend). The requirements for resolution must therefore be well-defined and deterministic, 
        enabling tool developers and parties exchanging OSCAL Profiles can work from a common understanding.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No requirements are placed on implementation-level details, instead, requirements are laid out as what the output of resolution must look like given a certain input.
         By adhering to these requirements OSCAL producers, OSCAL consumers, and any other members of the OSCAL ecosystem can create and resolve profiles deterministically, 
         with repeatable results, regardless of the tool used.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e27-head">Reading This Document</h2><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e30-head">Terminology</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many core OSCAL concepts are defined on the <a class="a" href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/terminology/">OSCAL Terminology Page</a>. The most important are repeated in this document, but readers should verify their understanding of all core OSCAL terms before reading this document.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, many terms in the wider domain have overloaded definitions. Unless defined otherwise by OSCAL or explicitly in this document, terms are to be understood as defined in the <a class="a" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary">NIST CSRC Glossary</a>.</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>
            <b class="term">profile</b>- an OSCAL Profile Document. Defines a set of inclusions, modifications, and transformations against a

          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">source</b>- refers to the profile document that is input into the profile resolution processor. This is the profile being resolved. In this document, when referring to objects from the
            <b class="term">source</b>document, the following style is used:
            <code class="src">source-object</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">target</b>- the intended output of the transformation, a catalog document. In this document, when referring to objects of a
            <b class="term">target</b>document, the following style is used:
            <code class="tgt">target-object</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">directive</b>- refers to an object or combination of objects in source documents, which is designed to affect a particular outcome in the target catalog. For the most part, directives are in the source profile document â€“ for example, a
            <code class="src">set-parameter</code>object in a source profile is a directive to set a parameter value in the target catalog.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">original order</b>- the order of objects as presented in the

          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">canonical order</b>- the order of objects as required in the appropriate OSCAL Model (Profile, Catalog, etc.). This can differ from the above order when converting between "ordered" formats (ex. XML), and "non-ordered" formats (ex. JSON).

In this document, YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is used to represent the various objects of the
        <b class="term">source</b>and
        <b class="term">target</b>. All examples and in-line references will be represented using
        <a class="a" href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML 1.2</a>.
      </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">YAML maps cleanly to JSON, thus allowing easy use of existing JSON/XML transformers where needed. With that in mind, the
        <a class="a" href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/latest/complete/json-reference/">OSCAL Complete JSON Reference</a>is a valuable resource for understanding the YAML-based information structures used in this document. All JSON properties and objects defined in the reference equate to a YAML mapping, list, or dictionary.
      </p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e147-head">Reading YAML Examples</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">YAML is a particularly human-readable format. For those unfamiliar with the format, the basics:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>Each line is a key-value pair, presented as
            <code class="code">key:value</code>, or as
            <code class="code">key:</code>with any number of list items on the following lines.
          </p></li><li><p>Indentation, spacing, and white space matters. Items below a key and indented one level in are members (or children) of that key.</p></li><li><p>List items are represented with a preceding dash
            <code class="code">- listitemkey:value</code>.
          </p></li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The YAML specification is freely available here:
        <a class="a" href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML 1.2</a>.
      </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, in order to unambiguously express information, this specification uses additional conventions, as described below.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some objects whose values must be determined dynamically at processing time. The most common example of this is timestamping output as it is processed. In this case, and any other dynamic-value cases, the expression
        <code class="code">${{ }}</code>is used.
      </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example:</p>{{< highlight xml>}}last-modified: ${{ timestamp }}{{</highlight>}}<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indicates the
        <code class="tgt">last-modified</code>object should be produced with contents generated appropriately, in this case, the timestamp at the time of processing.
      </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some examples may elide content to enhance readability or save space. In these cases, a YAML comment (any line that starts with
        <code class="code">#</code>) will be used to explain the elision.
      </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, although examples are syntactically faithful to OSCAL, they are not necessarily always formally valid in every respect. For example, OSCAL defines allowed property names (
        <code class="src">props</code>) and values, and those rules may not be observed here. Examples are given for purposes of illustrating profile resolution semantics only, and should not be taken as normative for any actual use.
      </p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e190-head">Document Layout</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specification is broken into the following major sections:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>
            <b class="term">Phases of Profile Resolution</b>- Lays out the necessary steps and phases of profile resolution. As each phase executes, the processor is understood to be creating and editing an intermediate representation of the output. There is one section for each of the three main phases.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <b class="term">Target Catalog Structure</b>- Provides the requirements for structuring the final output from the intermediate representation generated throughout the previous section.
          </p></li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <b class="term">Please note</b>: As referenced in the Purpose section
        [See: <a href="#d2e23-head" class="xref">Purpose</a>], this specification makes no hard requirements on the specifics of implementation. It is feasible for an implementation to use no intermediate representation, and to directly and iteratively build the output. As long as all processing and output requirements are satisfied, any approach is allowed. With that said, the specification has been laid out to aid in implementation by providing a clear organization as a sequence of distinct operations.
      </p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e210-head">The Intermediate and Implementation Guidance</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall intent of this document, in addition to defining strict requirements, is to provide rough guidelines on implementing an OSCAL Profile Resolution Tool. To this end, each phase of resolution will be framed as a series of transformations applied to an internal data structure that is persistent throughout the process. We call this "the intermediate".</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Any examples that are labelled as "Intermediate" are pseudo-code, designed to represent how this data structure might look as we apply different operations to it. The example intermediates are often not valid OSCAL, and are not to be taken as guidance, but rather a useful visualization tool for implementers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors believe that applying the steps of resolution in order against this intermediate representation is the simplest way to achieve full compliance with the specification. However, there is no requirement to implement profile resolution in this way. Requirements are given as rules on the output of resolution, and as such, tools can operate any way they would like internally.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e215-head">Phases of Profile Processing</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An OSCAL Profile has three major sections, each which correspond to a phase of profile resolution. In order to complete the profile resolution process, each section must be fully parsed and a catalog output created.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is strongly RECOMMENDED that implementations execute the following steps in the order that they are provided here (import, merge, modify). While it is possible to achieve compliance with a non-standard approach, the iterative nature of profile resolution lends itself to linear processing.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three steps are
      <b class="term">import</b>;
      <b class="term">merge</b>; and
      <b class="term">modify</b>. In brief:
    </p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>
          <b class="term">import</b>- identifies one or more control sources (catalogs or profiles) and defines the controls within them to be included in the result catalog. If nothing is imported, no resulting catalog is produced. Invoked by
          <code class="src">import</code>directives in source profiles;
        </p></li><li><p>
          <b class="term">merge</b>- designates the rules for how controls will be organized (ordered and/or grouped) and merged (addressing conflicts or ambiguities) in the result catalog. Controlled by the
          <code class="src">merge</code>directive in source profiles; if none are included, default merge rules are used;
        </p></li><li><p>
          <b class="term">modify</b>- indicates how controls and their parameters in the underlying catalog are to be altered, edited, amended or added in the final result catalog. Logical evaluation and parameter constraints provide advanced processing. Controlled by the
          <code class="src">modify</code>directive in source profiles. If a
          <code class="src">modify</code>directive is not provided, no changes will be made to the controls that have been imported/merged.
        </p></li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described in the previous section, when resolved, an OSCAL Profile takes the form of an OSCAL Catalog. The phases described below will produce outputs conforming to the catalog model.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e255-head">Import Phase</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A profile begins by listing a set of catalogs and/or profiles to be imported. Each is represented by a resolvable resource URI and a directive specifying which controls to import from that resource. These resources may be available as static resources, or they may be produced dynamically on request; such as is the case when a profile is imported. Imports are given in sequence after the metadata:</p>{{< highlight xml>}}

    {{</highlight>}}<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an import directive, the reference to the resource to be imported appears on an
      <code class="src">href</code>child object. It takes either of two forms, external or internal:

In order to ensure profile resolution results in the same catalog regardless of which tool resolves it, all imports must successfully resolve. While this may cause inconvenience if resources are frequently not available, it ensures interoperability.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that receiving a cached version of an import, or resolving an import that is otherwise unavailable through some other (but automatic) means still satisfies the above requirement. This specification does not put requirements on the precise function of the import, as long as the correct document is retrieved.</p><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e317-head">Internal References</h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">URI Fragments in OSCAL represent internal references to other OSCAL objects in the same document.

Profile resolution tools MUST be able to correctly handle add directives targetting nested controls. This includes directives that target a child control as well as directives that target a parent control and modify the child.  </p><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e1260-head">Removing contents from controls</h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contents inside controls can be removed from them in catalog targets. In combination with adding new contents, this feature can be used to edit controls as well as amend them.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A
          <code class="src">remove</code>directive inside an
          <code class="src">alter</code> directive identifies an object or set of objects inside a control to be removed. It does this using any of five child objects.
        </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> An object inside the control MUST be removed from the output if and only if it meets all of the criteria given by the child objects of the remove directive. When more than one child appears under the remove directive, an object would need to match all of them, otherwise it is not removed. </p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>
              The remove directive criteria <code class="src">by-id</code> MUST match an object if and only if its value is identical to the <code class="src">id</code> value of that object. Because
              <code class="src">id</code> values are unique, this criteria will result in the remove directive removing only a single object.

For example,
