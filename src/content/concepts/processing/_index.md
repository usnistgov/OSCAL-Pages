OSCAL data is intended to be processed in many ways for many different purposes. The specifications here describe normative processes, in the sense that all OSCAL processors that perform these operations should produce the same outputs from the same inputs under the same configuration. However, users and developers should find many ways to take advantage of data encoded in OSCAL, even beyond what is considered here.

**Please note that these specifications are currently a work in progress and are subject to change.** If you have any feedback or comments, please create an issue at the [NIST OSCAL Github Repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL)


# Profile Resolution Specification

The [Profile Resolution Specification](profile-resolution/) provides the standardized process for transforming an OSCAL Profile into an OSCAL Catalog. This specification is current a work in progress and is subject to change.
