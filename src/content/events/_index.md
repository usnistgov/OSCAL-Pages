## Recurring Events Details

The NIST OSCAL team hosts meetings and other events with the OSCAL community on different topics. We encourage you to attend these meetings as a way to keep up-to-date on and contribute to the development of OSCAL.
<br></br>
- ### **OSCAL Mini Workshops**
  The NIST OSCAL team is hosting a new series of mini workshops, that aims to address topics of interests for our community and to open tihs forum for its members to present their OSCAL-related work. Unless specifically states, the workshops will not require a deep technical understanding of OSCAL, and the dialogue is informal, allowing the community to interact with the presenters and with the OSCAL team members. 
  
  **[The Mini Workshops page](../learn/presentations/mini-workshop/)** contains a masterlist of all mini-workshop recordings and presentation slides. 
  
  **For up-to-date information about the workshops, please visit our [OSCAL CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/open-security-controls-assessment-language/oscal-adopters-workshops) page.**
